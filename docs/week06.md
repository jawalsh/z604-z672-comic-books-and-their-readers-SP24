### Discussion: Paratext show and tell

Browse through the comics in our "z672 Comics" folder on OneDrive or any other comics or related documents, and find an interesting paratext. In the discussion, describe your paratext. Your example may be a peritext (in the comic book) or an epitext (located outside the comic book).

In one or more paragraphs:
- Explain what the paratext is, its function, and its location. 
- Discuss how the paratext relates (or does not relate) to the comics content. 
- Include an image or screen capture of the paratext.
- Respond with substantive comments or questions to at least one peers.
- Submit your work in the Canvas [discussion](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204459/discussion_topics/13437195)

### Exploring fanmail activity

We will spend time in class individually looking for interesting examples of fan mail. Try to find two or three distinct examples. 

Keep notes on:

- Source of the fan mail: title, issue, date;
- topics discussed, e.g., story, plot, dialogue, art, characters, creators, process, current events, mistakes, criticisms, etc.;
- details the writers reveal about themselves, e.g., gender, occupation, etc.

After working individual, we will get together in small groups to share our findings, and then groups will report back to the full class.
