# Windows Command Line Basics
- list files/folders: 
	- `dir`
	- example: typing `dir` while in the Desktop folder will show you all folder and files in Desktop
- Where am I?: 
	- Windows shows you where you are in the file path automatically
   	- Or you can do `cd %HOMEDRIVE%`
 - use `/` or `\` to separate folders
- change directories
	- `cd filepath`
	- example: `cd Desktop/IA` to get to "IA" folder on Desktop
- move up one directory
	- `cd ..`
	- example: If I'm in the IA folder in Desktop and want to go back up to Desktop, I used `cd ..`
   	- Shortcut for homepath (C:\Users\username): %HOMEPATH%
   	  	- example: `cd %HOMEPATH%` takes you back to C:\Users\Alex\
   	  	- example: In Desktop and want to get to William and Mary folder inside Documents
	  		- `cd %HOMEPATH%\Documents\William and Mary\`
- create directories
	- `md foldername`
	- example: while in Desktop `md Google_Books` creates a folder called "Google_Books" in Desktop
- create text file
  	- `copy con filename.txt`
  	  	- Type text directly in command prompt, hit Ctrl+Z and then Enter to save
	- `echo textcontent > filename.txt`
   		- `echo Hello World! > file1.txt`
- delete files
	- `del filename`
	- example: `del file1.txt`
- copy files (to a new name, to a new directory)
	- `copy filepath-from filepath-to`
	- example: while in Desktop `copy file1.txt IA\file1.txt`
		- Copies file1.txt to IA folder in Desktop. There's one copy in Desktop and one in IA
	- example: while in Desktop `copy file1.txt IA\file2.txt`
		- Copies file1.txt to IA folder in Desktop and renames as file2.txt. There's one copy in Desktop and one in IA
- move files
	- `move filepath-from folder-to\`
	- example: while in Desktop `move file1.txt IA\`
		- Moves file1.txt from Desktop to IA folder
- %PATH%: the list of directories/folders where the OS looks for commands when you type a command
	- Hit Start button and search for environmental variables so that "Edit the system environmental variables" comes up
	- Click "environmental variables"
	- In the system under "System variables", select "Path" so it is highlighted, then click "Edit". A new window will pop up
	- Click "New" and type the filepath to where the folder for the executable command is on your computer (usually you've installed it in one of the program files folder)
- Commands must know the file path of images/documents they are working on. Providing complete path to files or being in the same directory as the files. Do that as part of copy or delete.
	- Example: To copy a file in Desktop you can...
		- navigate so that you are "in" the Desktop folder using `cd`. Then you only need to type the file name in the first part of copy: `copy file1.txt C:\Users\Alex\Documents\file1.txt`
		- Be in any folder and give the whole path to the Desktop: `copy C:\Users\Alex\Desktop\file1.txt C:\Users\Alex\Documents\file1.txt`
- open a file in the GUI (graphic user interface) from the command line: 
	- Just type filename with extension (e.g., file1.txt) and hit enter
- Navigating inside the command prompt window
	- Use up arrow to display previous commands
	- Use left and right arrows to move cursor inside your command
