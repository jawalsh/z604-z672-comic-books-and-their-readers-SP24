# Excel visualization walk-through
## Dataset
We're going to work with data for the Cooper Comics Collection. Download the dataset [here](https://mikrowelle.github.io/cooper-comics-final/data/Cooper%20Comics%20Reprint%20Metadata.xlsx)
## Filtering
Filtering lets you specify which data you want to see while you're looking at a spreadsheet.
1. When you've downloaded the dataset, open it in Excel.
2. There are different tabs (sheets) with different data about the collection.
3. Click on the tab "Cooper Collection Books" at the bottom
4. Take a minute to look through the different columns to understand what kind of data they contain.
5. One way to explore the data is through filtering. Select all the data in the sheet, then in Home > Editing > Sort & Filter, click "Filter."
6. This puts little drop-down triangle icons in the bottom right corner of each column header. If you click on it, a dropdown menu appears
7. On the menu, you can select, deselect, and search for different data. If we click the filter for Column M (No. Pages - Book), we see there are 8 choices for the number of pages in a comic book.
8. We could only want to see those books with 36 pages, and so we deselect all by unclicking "Select All" and then re-selecting "36" or type "36" in the search bar and hit enter. Now we only see those books with 36 pages. (See gif)
9. To get rid of the filter, we can click on the dropdown arrow again and hit "Clear Filter" or re-select "Select All" at the top. (See gif)
10. Filtering also allows you to sort your data. With Column M (No. Pages - Book), we can sort "smallest to largest" or "largest to smallest" since they are numbers. Text columns can be sorted A-Z to Z-A.
## Pivot tables
But how many comic books have 36 pages compared to those with a 100 pages? We could count sort smallest to largest and then count how many of each in the column. Or we could make the computer do it for us. That's what pivot tables are for!
1. Select all of the data in the "Cooper Collection Books" sheet.
2. Then go to Insert tab > Tables > PivotTable > From Data/Range
