# Regex Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, you'll practice creating regular expressions (regex). In a Word document or other text file, type your answers for the following questions.

**Note that for questions 4-8 there may be multiple answers. Just make sure your answer works! **

**Avoid Googling or consulting LLMs to find answers. Use a regex tester like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/)**

1. What are the characters to indicate the beginning and end of a string?
2. What does the pattern `b*` search for?
